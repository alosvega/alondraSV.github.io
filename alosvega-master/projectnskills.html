                Most projects I've completed are ones I've done during courses, this one during my first computer science course,
                Computing Fundamentals 1, where we learn on the basics of C++.

                Another completed project is this website! It is 100% done, I'm always updating it and looking for better ways to display 
                my content.

                    Traffic estimator: This code will ask for starting/ending location, car make, and all the details in order to estimate
                    whether or not it's worth taking public transportation. This code will also let you know the traffic going there and how much
                    gas it's going to roughly take. Recommendations of gas stations will also be provided.

        Skills
    </h2>
    <p>
        I've worked multiple jobs in which I've honed my skills throughout all of them. These skills include teamwork, communication, 
        and everything of that sort. I've handled cash in almost all of them and have operated multiple POS systems. 
        <br>
        With all these skills I've applied it to class as well, collaborating with others frequently for Labs done in class, projects,
        and coursework as well. This year I started as President for the Physics Club and Vice President for Women in Stem at Las Positas, 
        which in those roles combine both soft skills and hard skills. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my coursework in school I've gotten the opportunity to enhance more hard skills, such as learning 
        programs/technologies like MatLab, LaTex, VS Code, Eclipse, Github and Microsoft. (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.)
